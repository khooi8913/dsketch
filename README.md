# dSketch

This repository holds the implementation for the time-decaying in-network heavy-hitter detection algorithm, `dSketch`, proposed in the paper `Revisiting Heavy-Hitter Detection on Commodity Programmable Switches` accepted (and to be presented) at [IEEE NetSoft 2021](https://netsoft2021.ieee-netsoft.org/).

You can find the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492531).

## Usage/ Integration 
Please see [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) for more detail.

The implementation for `dSketch` can be found under the folder `dsketch/`. 

## Miscellaneous
The folder `misc/` holds the reference implementation for the other algorithms' evaluated in the paper.
